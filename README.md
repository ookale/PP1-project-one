# Throwback in History

This webpage is an information site for people interested in travelling and looking for a really exiting experience or maybe someone looking for bucket-list material.
The ancient horse race "Il Palio" dates back as far as 1633 and is of great importance to the residents of the small city of Siena, Italy. The webpage contains a brief presentation of what the Palio is and tries to give a feel of what to expect when visiting the race. This is also presented more in the history page and especially in the gallery from the images, and above all, the videos provided.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Header

The header consists of the name of the race in Italian "The Palio". I choose the Cinzel font as I think it goes well with the historic roots of the race and it's latin language origin. Black color on a light-blue background makes it easy to read.
Header features on all three pages to make the user familliar with it when navigating through the webpage.

- Navigation bar

The navigation bar consists of three tabs, in the same font as in the header, and easy to navigate and with a clear idea of what they do and the tabs change to a steel blue color when hovering over them. I wanted to go for a darker shae of light blue to give it some contrast from the header to let the user know it's a new part of the webpage. Also here the user can feel more secure as it features on all three pages as well.

- Main section Hero image

Here I placed a background image of the crowd during one of the races to give a feel of how it can look like when standing in the square looking out over the crowd. I decided to darken the image so the text boxes laying on top would not interfear with the image and vice versa. I used the same color as the header background color to give clarity to the site and work with a light Lato font to make reading more easy and not to crowded inside the boxes.

- Form 

Here the user can enter their Email-address if they want to subscribe to our newsletter to get more information on both the history and upcoming events. 
Clear heading lets the user know what is expected from them if they wish to subscribe. Wide field with placeholder text for easier understanding and an Email required field. Large button next to the input field where the information on the button also gives the user understanding for what the button does. Same background color as the navigation bar for clarity across the webpage.

- Footer

Here I use the same background color as the header to continue giving clarity for the whole webpage. 
Icons for the user to interact with and the social media links open in a new tab.

- History page
In this page I wanted to make the user experience something well-known so iI did the layout with the same hero image but decided to place the content text in 4 boxes. Same colors as in the index page and the light Lato font to make the text less crowded and easier to read. Also again for clarity to the user. Same design for header, navigation bar and footer as in the home page.

- Gallery page

For the gallery I wanted to provide images that gives the user a feel for what the event is about. Masonry layout to the gallery for a smoother viewing pleasure and in this page I decided to remove the background image as that would interfear with the gallery images shown. White-smoke background but the same layout as in the other pages on the header, navigation bar and footer. Videos provided to further enhance the feeling of what the Palio is all about.

## Features left to implement

- I would like to add a page where the user can read more in detail about the different districts of the city. Pictures of their symbols and colors to go along with written information. Also a map showing where in the city you can encounter the different districts. 

- Include more in detail tips on travelling there, how to get around and where to stay.

Googled on how to push the text blocks down on the home page since the background image followed and found this site that helped me get them into place.
