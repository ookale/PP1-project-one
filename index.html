            <span>Every year between the 29th of june and 2nd of August the main square in Siena, Piazza del Campo is transformed into a colorful event 
                filled with chanting inhabitants, waving the flag of their own district (or Contrada) hoping for their jockey to be the lucky one. 
                Once the race is underway there is only one rule to keep in mind: There are no rules!
