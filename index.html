                Every year on the 2nd of August the main square in Siena, Piazza del Campo is transformed into a colorful event 
                filled with chanting inhabitants, waving the flag of their own district (or Contrada) hoping for their jockey to be the lucky one. 
                Once the race is underway there is only one rule to keep in mind: There are no rules!
                This historic tradition dates to 1633 and takes place twice a year. Yes, also on the 16th of August the race is on again.

               There is fierce competition and rivalry between the various contradas and the prestige of winning the Palio is of great 
               importance to the inhabitants of each contrada. There are 17 different contradas and only 10 out of the 17 take part in each race 
               (10 on July 2 and 10 on August 16): 7 that did not participate in the previous race will run in the next one, while the remaining 
               three are drawn at random. This means that a contrada may be running both, one or no races at all.
