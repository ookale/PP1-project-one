                The Palio is a huge tradition that lasts a total of four days, from the warm-ups on the morning of
                June 29 until the races on July 2 and again from August 13-16 for the next Palio.
                The first day involves the drawing of the lots and when the horses
                are assigned to each district.

                The districts have their own jockey but not their own horse.
                The city hosts 6 trial runs before the official race, one in the morning and one in the afternoon,
                but jockeys try to avoid tiring their horses too much.

                There are 17 different districts and only 10 out of the
                17 take part in each race (10 on July 2 and 10 on August 16)
                <br> <br>
                The 7 that did not participate in the previous race will run in
                the next one, while the remaining
                three are drawn at random. This means that a contrada may be running both, one or no races at all.

                The race only lasts about a minute, as the horses must complete three full laps around the square 
                the first horse that crosses the finish line after the third lap wins. The horse can also finish without the jockey.
                This race is rather dangerous, especially in certain places on the square and accidents have occurred in the past.
