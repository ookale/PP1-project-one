                The first day involves the drawing of the lots when the horses
                are assigned to each district. The districts have their own jockey but not their own horse.
                <br><br>
                Each districts also have its own museum showcasing memorabilia and its past victories,
                not to mention the many churches where each horse is blessed on the day of the race
            </p>

        <div id="textblock-right-top">

                Caterpillar, Dragon, Eagle, Forest, Giraffe, Goose, Owl, Panther, Porcupine, Ram, 
                She-Wolf, Seashell, Snail, Tortoise, Tower, Unicorn and Wave are the 17 districts and each  
                features its own emblem and colors
                <br><br>
                As proof of their sense of pride, youâ€™ll only be part of a district if you're born into it.

        <div id="textblock-left-bottom">

                Only 10 out of the 17 districts take part in each race (10 on July 2 and 10 on August 16)
                <br> <br>
                The 7 that did not participate in the previous race will run in
                the next one, while the remaining
                three are drawn at random. This means that a contrada may be running both, one or no races at all.
            </p>

        <div id="textblock-right-bottom">

                The race only lasts about a minute, as the horses must complete three full laps around the square
                the first horse that crosses the finish line after the third lap wins.
                <br><br>
                The horse can also finish without the jockey. This race is rather dangerous, especially in
                certain places on the square and accidents have occurred in the past.
